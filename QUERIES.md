# Enhanced Query Generation Framework for Maximum Concurrency

## Introduction

This framework transforms project requirements documentation into a comprehensive set of detailed, contextual queries that maximize parallel execution. By atomizing work into the smallest possible independent units, we enable teams to achieve the highest possible development velocity through concurrent execution.

## Core Principles

- **Maximum Concurrency**: Generate the highest possible number of independent tasks that can be executed simultaneously
- **Forward Planning**: Design Phase 1 tasks with awareness of downstream dependencies in later phases
- **Interface-First Development**: Define clear interfaces early to unblock dependent components
- **Atomic Task Design**: Break requirements into the smallest independently executable units
- **Self-Contained Context**: Provide sufficient context for autonomous execution

## Process Flow

1. **Documentation Analysis**
   - Parse requirements to identify all functionality requirements
   - Map current codebase structure and identify existing components
   - Create a gap analysis between current state and required functionality
   - Identify technical constraints and system boundaries
   - Extract all potential independent work units

2. **Requirement Atomization**
   - Break down requirements into atomic units (aim for 10+ concurrent tasks in Phase 1)
   - Identify shared interfaces and foundation components
   - Split complex features into independent micro-components
   - Extract cross-cutting concerns into separate tasks
   - Establish clear boundaries between different functional domains

3. **Comprehensive Dependency Mapping**
   - For each identified requirement:
     - Create a detailed dependency graph showing relationships between components
     - Identify foundation components that enable maximum downstream development
     - Map all upstream and downstream dependencies
     - Prioritize components that unblock the most other tasks
     - Identify critical path components that require immediate attention

4. **Interface-First Planning**
   - Prioritize interface definitions in Phase 1 to enable parallel development of dependent components
   - Create mock implementations for interfaces to unblock dependent components
   - Define validation contracts between components
   - Establish data format and structure standards
   - Document API contracts for all component interactions

5. **Query Generation Optimization**
   - Generate at least 10 concurrent queries for Phase 1
   - Group queries into phases based on dependency chains
   - Optimize for balanced workload distribution
   - Ensure all critical path components are identified and prioritized
   - Include forward-looking context in Phase 1 queries to enable seamless integration in later phases

## Phase Planning Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Components (10+ Concurrent Queries)

- Focus on components with no dependencies that enable downstream development
- Prioritize interface definitions and core functionality
- Include shared utilities and common services
- Establish patterns and standards for later phases
- Create mock implementations where beneficial for future phases

### Subsequent Phases:

- Build upon completed Phase 1 components
- Integrate foundation components into higher-level features
- Implement business logic dependent on foundation components
- Focus on user-facing features and integration points
- Include validation and verification components
