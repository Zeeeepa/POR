# Webhook Module Structure

## REQUIRED

This document outlines the core structure and requirements for the webhook module.

### Core Components

1. **WebhookServer**
   - Responsible for receiving and processing GitHub webhook events
   - Must validate webhook signatures for security
   - Must support ngrok integration for exposing local server
   - Must provide flexible event registration system

2. **NgrokManager**
   - Manages ngrok tunnels for exposing local servers
   - Must handle tunnel creation and cleanup
   - Must provide error handling for ngrok operations

3. **Dashboard**
   - Provides web UI for monitoring webhook activity
   - Must display event history and statistics
   - Must provide filtering and search capabilities

4. **Validation**
   - Provides consistent parameter validation
   - Must validate all inputs to prevent security issues
   - Must provide helpful error messages

5. **Error Handling**
   - Provides standardized error handling
   - Must categorize errors by type
   - Must include appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Must support detailed error logging

### Required Functionality

1. **Webhook Processing**
   - Receive webhook payloads from GitHub
   - Validate webhook signatures
   - Route events to appropriate handlers
   - Provide acknowledgment responses

2. **Event Handling**
   - Register custom handlers for different event types
   - Process events asynchronously
   - Provide error handling for event processing

3. **Webhook Setup**
   - Configure webhooks on GitHub repositories
   - Support multiple event types
   - Avoid duplicate webhook creation

4. **Dashboard Monitoring**
   - Display recent events
   - Show statistics by event type and repository
   - Provide filtering and search capabilities
   - Display event details

5. **Error Management**
   - Provide consistent error handling
   - Log errors with appropriate detail
   - Return standardized error responses

### Integration Points

1. **GitHub API**
   - Create and manage webhooks
   - Authenticate with GitHub token

2. **Express.js**
   - Handle HTTP requests
   - Serve dashboard UI
   - Provide API endpoints

3. **Ngrok**
   - Create public URLs for local servers
   - Manage tunnel lifecycle

## Architecture

The webhook module follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
webhook/
├── webhookServer.js    # Main webhook server implementation
├── dashboard.js        # Dashboard UI implementation
├── example.js          # Example usage
├── views/              # EJS templates for dashboard
└── public/             # Static assets for dashboard
```

Supporting utilities:

```
utils/
├── NgrokManager.js     # Ngrok tunnel management
├── validation.js       # Input validation
├── errorHandler.js     # Error handling
└── logger.js           # Logging
```

## Data Flow

1. GitHub sends webhook event to WebhookServer
2. WebhookServer validates signature and parses payload
3. Event is logged to dashboard history
4. Event is dispatched to registered handler
5. Handler processes event and performs actions
6. Dashboard displays event history and statistics

## Error Handling

All errors should be handled using the standardized error handling system:

1. Validation errors (400)
2. Authentication errors (401)
3. Authorization errors (403)
4. Not found errors (404)
5. Conflict errors (409)
6. External service errors (502)
7. Internal errors (500)
8. Webhook-specific errors (400)

## Security Considerations

1. All webhook payloads must be validated with signatures
2. GitHub tokens must be securely stored
3. Input validation must be applied to all parameters
4. Error messages must not expose sensitive information
